YAGPT
=====
Yet another gdb python API tutorial.
This demo code aims to show how to replace gdb shell-like interface
 with something that is more programming language like.
Because a gdb script just feels like a shell script.

Features
--------
* seamlessly attach/detach from a running process
* more readable & modular than gdb
* practicing some dynamic library loading trickery no-one should ever user
* fast (just kidding)

Licence
-------
MIT, if you need one

RTFM for reference
